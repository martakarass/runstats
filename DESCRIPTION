Description: Provides methods for fast computation of running sample 
    statistics for time series. These include: (1) mean, (2) 
    standard deviation, and (3) variance over a fixed-length window 
    of time-series, (4) correlation, (5) covariance, and (6) 
    Euclidean distance (L2 norm) between short-time pattern and 
    time-series. Implemented methods utilize Convolution Theorem to 
    compute convolutions via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT).
