## Other comments

This is 2nd submission. As for the remarks I received from 1st submission: 

    Thanks, if there are references describing the methods in your package, 
    please add these in the Description field of your DESCRIPTION file in 
    the form

    authors (year) <arXiv:...>
    authors (year, ISBN:...)
    with no space after 'doi:', 'arXiv:' and angle brackets for auto-linking.

There are NO references describing the methods in this package. 

    Please replace \dontrun{} by \donttest{} or unwap the examples if they 
    can be executed in less than 5 sec per Rd-file.
